      "q1": {
        "question": "How does the game work?",
        "answer": "You’ll be shown a series of random (pre-generated) images and you must guess whether each one is a real photograph or AI-generated. The website has many photos in its database (700+), so each game will be unique."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Where did these photos come from?",
        "answer": "On the one hand, the ‘real’ photos were obtained from Unsplash, using the Unsplash license that allows free use. On the other hand, the AI-generated photos were created using the Nano Bannana Pro model (gemini-3-pro-image-preview)."

      "q3": {
        "question": "Can I play remotely with friends?",
        "answer": "Yes! Choose the ‘With Friends’ mode, create a room, and share the QR code or room code with your friends. They can join from any device with a web browser."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Who created this and why?",
        "answer": "I’m Pablo (the one who appears at the bottom of each page on this site), I’m a computer engineering student and I created this project (in approx. 24 hours) to try to raise general public awareness of how hard it currently is to distinguish real images from AI-generated images."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Is this website open source?",
        "answer": "Yes! The code for this website is available on GitHub, the link is in the header of the page and published under an Apache 2.0 license. You can go take a look if you want to learn how it works under the hood or even contribute."
